More range, higher speeds and increase broadcasting capacity.

## [English Version]

Bluetooth 5.0 has been promoted in the smartphone market which be announced in 2016.
Besides Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are common wireless networking technology on IOT application,
and Zigbee which is supported widely in the IOT industry.
Low-power Zigbee and its advantages of supporting many kinds of Network Topology,
but with slow-growth of industry, it is not universal.
(And announcing of Thread in 2014)
For one thing, it is worth noting that Bluetooth 5.0 support Mesh Topology (A kind of Network framework),
and the number of “things to things” (T2T) interconnects is higher,
and it is more convenient for application of IOT and Wearable devices.
For another thing, increase ability of anti-interference，
In the past, ISM band of Bluetooth is identical to other wireless network.
So that bluetooth easy to be interfered, and packet easy to be dropped when it was passing,
and message transmission will occur error and failure.
(Tip：Both of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi ISM band is 2.4GHz.)
Most popular of wireless technology using smart electronic products is Wi-Fi,
however, Wi-Fi is higher power and cost and easy to be snooped than other technology.
It means that Wi-Fi is now mainstream, but Bluetooth 5.0 might be more competitive and commercialized in the future.



## [Chinese version]

2016年所宣布的藍牙5.0目前已經在行動裝置市場上正式推動
除了藍牙，在物聯網(IOT)應用上最廣泛的無線感知網路技術
還有WiFi，以及目前受到業界廣泛支持的Zigbee
續航力高的Zigbee技術，且支援多種網路拓樸之優勢，但產業推動緩慢，較不普及
(還有2014年提出的Thread無線網路技術，暫時不提)
值得一提的是，藍牙5.0最大突破，是支援Mesh拓樸 (一種網路架構)
能夠T2T的互聯數量就更高，對於IOT的應用及穿戴式裝置將會更加便捷。
其二是抗干擾能力提升，過去的藍牙與其他無線網路頻段相同，容易受到訊號干擾，封包資料的傳遞途中容易掉落，訊息傳遞就會失敗及錯誤
Tip：藍牙 與 Wi-Fi 的使用頻段皆為2.4GHz
現主流智慧電子產品使用的無線網路技術為WiFi，然而WiFi相較於其他兩者較為耗電、成本較高，且容易被監聽 (第三方侵入)
意味著，雖然WiFi為主流，但藍芽5.0在未來將可能有更強大的競爭力及商業化。
